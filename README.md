# AndroidTicTacToe

A feature-rich Android application for playing Tic Tac Toe in both single-player and multiplayer modes. The game supports AI opponents and peer-to-peer multiplayer.


*Note: This is a legacy project created during early Android development learning. While functional, the codebase reflects learning-stage coding practices and is maintained for historical/portfolio purposes.*

## Features

- üéÆ Classic Tic Tac Toe gameplay
- ü§ñ Single-player mode with adjustable AI difficulty
- ü§ù Multiplayer mode (peer-to-peer device connectivity)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable game settings
- üì± Smooth Android UI and transitions
- üì° Event-driven architecture for real-time gameplay

## How Multiplayer Works

The multiplayer mode allows two Android devices to connect and play in real time. It uses local device discovery and connectivity (via Bluetooth and local Wi-Fi). Events such as device discovery, connection, and move synchronization are handled using a custom event system:

- `DeviceFoundEvent` ‚Äì Triggered when a nearby player is found
- `DeviceConnectedEvent` ‚Äì Fired upon successful connection
- `OpponentMoveEvent` ‚Äì Transmits moves between players
- `PlayerDisconnectedEvent` ‚Äì Handles disconnections gracefully

## AI Difficulty Levels

In single-player mode, users can choose from multiple AI difficulty levels:

- **Easy** ‚Äì AI makes random or simple moves
- **Medium** ‚Äì AI uses basic strategies to block or win
- **Hard** ‚Äì AI plays optimally using algorithms like Minimax

This provides a fun challenge for players of all skill levels.

## Architecture Overview

The project follows a modular structure:

- `activities/` ‚Äì UI logic for each screen (`HomeActivity`, `GameActivity`, etc.)
- `events/` ‚Äì Event bus-style communication between components
- `enums/` ‚Äì Defines shared constants like `GameState`
- `GameApplication.java` ‚Äì Application-level configuration and initialization
- `AndroidManifest.xml` ‚Äì Declares app permissions and components

This structure helps separate concerns and improve maintainability.
